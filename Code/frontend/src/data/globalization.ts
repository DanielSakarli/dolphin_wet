		userManualHungerThirst:
			'Body condition scoring (BCS, a visual assessment of muscle and fat cover) and weight are well-accepted welfare measures used for numerous terrestrial and marine animals, both in the wild and under human care (e.g., WelfareQuality 2009; Roche et al. 2009; Hart et al. 2017; Lauderdale et al. 2019). The Dolphin-WET includes a BCS measure where the assessor visually evaluates the animal during multiple activities (e.g training, during free time, when performing aerial jumps, beaching). A  five-point likert scale (from emaciated to obese) established by Clegg et al. (2015) is used here and is translated into a 3-point scale, as well as the graphic developed in this study (Credit: Universities Federation for Animal Welfare, UFAW). A second animal-based measure regarding the animals nutritional status is the “Weight Oscillation along the Year” indicator, which assesses how the animal’s weight changes as a percentage of the total, using a year’s worth of weight data. Wild dolphins accumulate more blubber in the winter as water temperatures decrease (Worthy et al. 1990; Noren & Wells 2009), so some changes in weight throughout the year should be observed, when feeding rations are accorded to water and ambient temperatures changes. Given that no literature is available on normal and abnormal weight oscillations in human care settings, a pilot study was conducted in several EAAM facilities to conservatively establish these thresholds, using data from healthy animals and those experiencing health or welfare challenges. It was found that a weight oscillation of 13% or less over the year, and 5% or less across a 3-month period, would likely not represent a welfare concern but that oscillations outside these thresholds would likely indicate a welfare issue., for this indicator a 2-point scoring is applied.',
		userManualAdequateDiet:
			'Dolphins under human care should be fed on fish and cephalopod species that meet their nutritional and hydration needs (Gannon & Waples 2004; Slifka et al. 2013), whilst being palatable. The diet’s nutritional and hydration content should be monitored and managed when appropriate. An inadequate diet can cause the animal to be lethargic, thirsty, hungry, and/or cause disease and malnutrition. The selected indicators are the calculation of the diet by using kcal with a 2-level scoring and the blood parameters for an adequate hydration with a 3-point scoring',
		userManualFoodQuality:
			'Dolphins under human care should be fed with fish that are fit for human consumption, and the quality of purchased batches should be monitored and managed. Fish quality can differ with species, marine location, season, and storage and handling methods. Shelf life is dependent on three criteria: packaging, storage temperature and fish species (Joseph & Antrim 2010). Poor fish quality can cause the animal to be lethargic, thirsty, hungry, and/or cause disease and malnutrition. For the fish quality the selected indicators are microbiological and physicochemical values required by the EAAM S&G, therefore a 2-level scoring is used.',
		userManualFoodVariety:
			'Wild dolphins feed on a large range of fish species, varying their diet with season, prey availability and quality, and other factors (Gannon & Waples 2004). Feeding a large variety of fish species, which is the 6th indicator, to animals in human care is likely to aid in supplying all necessary nutrients to the animals, more closely mimic their natural diet, and maintain their appetites more effectively. Depending on the number of species fed, the adaptation of individual needs and the provision of food enrichment a 3-point-scoring is used.',

		userManualHungerThirst:
			'Body condition scoring (BCS, a visual assessment of muscle and fat cover) and weight are well-accepted welfare measures used for numerous terrestrial and marine animals, both in the wild and under human care (e.g., WelfareQuality 2009; Roche et al. 2009; Hart et al. 2017; Lauderdale et al. 2019). The Dolphin-WET includes a BCS measure where the assessor visually evaluates the animal during multiple activities (e.g training, during free time, when performing aerial jumps, beaching). A  five-point likert scale (from emaciated to obese) established by Clegg et al. (2015) is used here and is translated into a 3-point scale, as well as the graphic developed in this study (Credit: Universities Federation for Animal Welfare, UFAW). A second animal-based measure regarding the animals nutritional status is the “Weight Oscillation along the Year” indicator, which assesses how the animal’s weight changes as a percentage of the total, using a year’s worth of weight data. Wild dolphins accumulate more blubber in the winter as water temperatures decrease (Worthy et al. 1990; Noren & Wells 2009), so some changes in weight throughout the year should be observed, when feeding rations are accorded to water and ambient temperatures changes. Given that no literature is available on normal and abnormal weight oscillations in human care settings, a pilot study was conducted in several EAAM facilities to conservatively establish these thresholds, using data from healthy animals and those experiencing health or welfare challenges. It was found that a weight oscillation of 13% or less over the year, and 5% or less across a 3-month period, would likely not represent a welfare concern but that oscillations outside these thresholds would likely indicate a welfare issue., for this indicator a 2-point scoring is applied.',
		userManualAdequateDiet:
			'Dolphins under human care should be fed on fish and cephalopod species that meet their nutritional and hydration needs (Gannon & Waples 2004; Slifka et al. 2013), whilst being palatable. The diet’s nutritional and hydration content should be monitored and managed when appropriate. An inadequate diet can cause the animal to be lethargic, thirsty, hungry, and/or cause disease and malnutrition. The selected indicators are the calculation of the diet by using kcal with a 2-level scoring and the blood parameters for an adequate hydration with a 3-point scoring',
		userManualFoodQuality:
			'Dolphins under human care should be fed with fish that are fit for human consumption, and the quality of purchased batches should be monitored and managed. Fish quality can differ with species, marine location, season, and storage and handling methods. Shelf life is dependent on three criteria: packaging, storage temperature and fish species (Joseph & Antrim 2010). Poor fish quality can cause the animal to be lethargic, thirsty, hungry, and/or cause disease and malnutrition. For the fish quality the selected indicators are microbiological and physicochemical values required by the EAAM S&G, therefore a 2-level scoring is used.',
		userManualFoodVariety:
			'Wild dolphins feed on a large range of fish species, varying their diet with season, prey availability and quality, and other factors (Gannon & Waples 2004). Feeding a large variety of fish species, which is the 6th indicator, to animals in human care is likely to aid in supplying all necessary nutrients to the animals, more closely mimic their natural diet, and maintain their appetites more effectively. Depending on the number of species fed, the adaptation of individual needs and the provision of food enrichment a 3-point-scoring is used.',
